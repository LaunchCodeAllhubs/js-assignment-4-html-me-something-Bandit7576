         <p id="testp" class="funParagraph">Have you ever wondered what it would be like to fly
             a jet? Well, riding a sportbike is the next best thing!
             Modern sportbikes are capable of speeds well in excess of 150 mph, the sensation
              of speed is increased exponentially though, thanks to the fact that you are on the
               machine and not inside it. Even at road legal speeds bikes will always feel faster,
                sportbikes in particular force you into a natural tuck position which also just feels fast, too.
         </p>
         <p>Sportbikes are designed with speed in mind, every part of their design is there to help the 
            rider operate effectively at speed. On track, they are most at home chasing the clock. Fun
             can be had on a canyon road too, the
             agility of the chassis can be taken to its limit and the acceleration out of a corner will 
             make anyone feel like a racer.
         </p>
         <p>I have been riding motorcycles for many years. The first time I got on a sportbike, my life
             changed. I own a 2014 Honda CBR 1000 rr. I have included some pictuers. My bike used to be
              black, but I put a new set of body panels on to changethe look. I will also include a video
               of me and a couple of friends racing. The fastest I have been on my bike is 177 mph! I hope
                you enjoy it!
